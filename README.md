# Bengaluru-House-Price-Prediction

Banglore House Price Prediction Model
This is a data science project to predict the price of houses in bengaluru. I have build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore house prices dataset from kaggle.com. Next, to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 

During model building I have tried to cover almost all data science concepts such as data loading,data cleaning,outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.

Technologies and tools used in this project - 

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
